    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm is one that exhibits good time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing the time taken to execute.</p>

    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is often denoted by the notation O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration in optimizing algorithms, especially in scenarios where memory resources are limited.</p>
